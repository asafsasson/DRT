Asaf Sasson  - test 

As part of the test I was asked to make a website that asks for a singer's name and returns his Hebrew date of birth,
What actually happens is that the user enters the singer's name,
and i use it in GET Action to gets the details about the singer (if any).
Once I get the details about the singer I check if his date of birth exists,
if he exists I use the GET Action for another API and there I get his Hebrew date of birth.
